# ðŸ’¢ Intersections and collisions

The concepts of **intersections** and **collisions** are tightly related
ideas.

An **intersection** is the more primitive of the two, describing simply the
(global) where a collision happened.

A **collision** contains intersection as one of its data points. But it contains
additional information, such as the involved shapes.
